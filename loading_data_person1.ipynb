That means: \n","1. Loading and exploring the data\n","2. Running initial models \n","## Features of this Notebook \n","1. Easy to access the data \n","2. Has tesla t4 GPU which is a top tier GPU with 16gb memory\n","3. Has 500 gb local storage \n","4. It now supports a file system with a text editor (similar to jupyter lab) \n","5.
