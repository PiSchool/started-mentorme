That means: \n","1. Loading and exploring the data\n","2. Running initial models \n","## Features of this Notebook \n","1. Easy to access the data \n","2. Has tesla t4 GPU which is a top tier GPU with 16gb memory\n","3. Has 500 gb local storage \n","4. It now supports a file system with a text editor (similar to jupyter lab) \n","5. Sadly, it only has 12 gb of system memory\n","## Connecting it to google drive: \n","1. Make sure you are working on the google account given to you by us: the @picampus-school.com account. \n","2. First, you need to add the proejct folder we shared with you to my drive. \n","3. then you can run the notebook below"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"fwHRMaid9hie","colab_type":"code","outputId":"319993c4-17da-4baf-b273-318279347dae","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1572024415740,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":34755,"user":{"displayName":"Leander Loew","photoUrl":"","userId":"03704519067413646724"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":121}},"source":["import sys\n","from google.colab import drive\n","#remember to select your @picampus- school account here for mounting\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Go to this URL in a browser: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=947318989803-6bn6qk8qdgf4n4g3pfee6491hc0brc4i.apps.googleusercontent.com&redirect_uri=urn%3Aietf%3Awg%3Aoauth%3A2.0%3Aoob&scope=email%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fdocs.test%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fdrive%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fdrive.photos.readonly%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fpeopleapi.readonly&response_type=code\n","\n","Enter your authorization code:\n","··········\n","Mounted at /content/drive\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"o2eoD6rD9lDr","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":230},"outputId":"f43d1595-a84a-4928-b691-65148ab77d63","executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1572024417969,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":1102,"user":{"displayName":"Leander Loew","photoUrl":"","userId":"03704519067413646724"}}},"source":["import sys,os\n","PROJECT_NAME=\"started-startups\"\n","\n","#changing directory to google colab directory #\n","#os.chdir(f\"/content/drive/My Drive/{PROJECT_NAME}/{PROJECT_NAME}-github#\")\n","os.chdir(f\"/content/drive/My Drive/{PROJECT_NAME}/{PROJECT_NAME}-github\")\n","\n","#this is to be able to load the data from the shared stakeholder folder: Don't write \n","#anything there. \n","STAKEHOLDER_DATA_PATH=f\"/content/drive/My Drive/{PROJECT_NAME}/shared_with_stakeholder/data/\""],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"FileNotFoundError","evalue":"ignored","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mFileNotFoundError\u001b[0m                         Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-2-65cfc79107c0>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<module>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      4\u001b[0m \u001b[0;31m#changing directory to google colab directory #\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      5\u001b[0m \u001b[0;31m#os.chdir(f\"/content/drive/My Drive/{PROJECT_NAME}/{PROJECT_NAME}-github#\")\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 6\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0mos\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0mchdir\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34mf\"/content/drive/My Drive/{PROJECT_NAME}/{PROJECT_NAME}-github\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m      7\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      8\u001b[0m \u001b[0;31m#this is to be able to load the data from the shared stakeholder folder: Don't write\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;31mFileNotFoundError\u001b[0m: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/content/drive/My Drive/started-startups/started-startups-github'"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"0qCcgTxj9neI","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
